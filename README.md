# Catstagram

The purpose of this training is to practice The Elm Architecture (TEA) with the React ecosystem.

> ðŸ“Œ This training is incremental, each exercise is a step to the solution. You only need to push the result of the last exercice (or the latest you succeed to do). It will be part of your evaluation.

For this training we use [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle our app. It provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects

To run the project:
- `npm install` (or `npm i`)
- `npm run dev` to run project with hot reload, in development mode.


Others npm commands :
- `npm run build` provides a way to build your app on production mode and put the result in the `dist` folder.
- `npm run test` launchs your tests written with [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check)

This training have two parts:
1. [Meet TEA](./doc/part1.md)
2. [Create your catstagram](./doc/part2.md)
